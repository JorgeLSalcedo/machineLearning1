We develop a script that identify all the words that begin with capitalized letters. \r\n\r\nFor instances, proper personal names \"Carlos, Laia, Joan\", as well as places: \"Barcelona, New York, Notre Dam, Eiffel Tower , etc\". The script creates a library of all the capitalizes word and in this list of word, the script cheks if the word can be geolocalized.\r\n\r\n##How the script geolocalizes.\r\nThe script use wikipedia API, each time it finds a new word that begin with capital letter, it connects with Wikipedia and chekcks if the  word can be geolocalized. If the word has not been geolocalized the program save the pale in the library with its coordinates. In this way the search for the next time its going to be more efficient because if the word is on the library we have to to connect againg with wikipedia.\r\n\r\n###Why wikipedia and not a geolocalization library. \r\n\r\nWkipedia give us the chance to develop a personalize tools for almost any type of language. In this first beta version the courpus of news (text) is in catala, but we can adapt relatevy easy or script to courpus on any languagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors (alphabetic order) \r\n, Adria XXX, Roderic XXX, Jorge L Salcedo, Manel Vidal, Josep Zapata  founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
